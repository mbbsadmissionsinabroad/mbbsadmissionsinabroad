                There are 2 main ways to become a nurse in Germany & that are
                University Degree & Vocational Training. Both are of 3 years &
                enable the candidates to work as a nurse but University degree
                provides more opportunities for future career. Vocational
                Training will require a significant amount of experience to be
                able to move forward. The most popular path is when after
                completing a program, they become nurse teachers at vocational
                schools. But most of them also combine their nurse job at the
                hospital with the teaching profession. A qualified nursing
                student in German will get a job post when they are enrolled in
                the program.
